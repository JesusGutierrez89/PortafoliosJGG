        "description": "I was a teacher for young children (where I learned to have Jedi-level patience), I worked in a kitchen (where the recipe was always 'improvise or die'), I sold cars (without knowing about engines, but with a lot of drama)... and after a thousand jobs I discovered the most addictive of all: programming, where debugging is my new extreme sport.",

        "p2": "There I discovered the value of communication, patience, and adaptability—skills I now apply in software development.",
        "p3": "My curiosity for technology led me to study for a Higher Level Certificate in Multiplatform Application Development at IES Ingeniero de la Cierva (2025). I later had the opportunity to intern at SEWAN, developing software for SD-WAN Box with Node.js and React.",
        "p4": "During this time, I have worked with Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, and React, as well as databases like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. I also apply agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, design REST APIs, and use Docker to deploy projects.",
        "p5": "Artificial Intelligence has become a great ally in my daily work, thanks to tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor IDE, and ChatGPT.",
        "p6": "Beyond the technical, I value my ability to explain complex ideas, work in a team, solve problems, and learn continuously.",
        "p7": "In 2025, I was recognized with an Accésit in the Database specialty at the XV Informatics Olympiad of the Region of Murcia. Today, I continue to explore new technologies with a clear goal: to turn ideas into useful solutions and add value to every project.",
        "p8": "It is also relevant to mention that I have a recognized 33% disability, which does not impact my mobility or my ability to fully carry out my professional duties. In fact, it has reinforced my resilience and my commitment to overcoming challenges."
